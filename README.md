# Distracted-Driver-CNN-Keras
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras and TensorFlow to classify a driver's state from a large image dataset. The goal is to detect distracted driving behaviors, demonstrating a full machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model training.
